# Coding-and-Financial-Analysis-agent

This project demonstrates how to set up and utilize conversational AI agents to perform financial analysis tasks, specifically creating a stock analysis plot. The process involves configuring agents with coding capabilities and integrating user-defined functions to enhance their efficiency. The agents will collaborate to generate code that downloads stock data and plots stock gains year-to-date (YTD) for specific companies. This lesson highlights the steps needed to configure the agents, define tools, and execute a collaborative task.
